<p>This submission, taking place completely within the console, allows the user to input the side lengths of a triangle and then outputs the trigonometric ratios created by each side length in a table.</p>

<p>This submission allows the user to create a customizable simulation based on the rules of John Conway’s <em>Game of Life</em>, in which the user can place and remove tiles to be modified in the simulation. It is supposed to entertain the user.</p>

<p>I ended up scoring exactly the same as the College Board criteria. There was one case (Submission 1’s “Algorithm Implementation”) that I graded it a 0 initially, but then realized that there was a for loop at the bottom of the function in question. I thought there wasn’t iteration, which was the reason I had given it a 0 in the first place, so I changed it to a 1.</p>

<p>While I ended up grading things the same, being forced to scrutinize the Create Task rubric makes me a lot more confident that I’ll be able to meet the requirements easily. How will I do it? I wrote a bit about that below.</p>

<h3 id="how-i-can-meet-the-requirements">
<a class="anchor" href="#how-i-can-meet-the-requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How I Can Meet the Requirements?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Very clearly distinguish between purpose and function. The function is what the program literally does and the purpose is why that function matters/what its effect is on the user.</li>
  <li>Store and call information in a list, specifically information that is made more easily accessible by it being in a list.</li>
  <li>Include a aptly-named method that incorporates sequencing (correctly ordering events chronologically in the function), selection (can be an if statement or other conditional), and iteration (loops, baby).</li>
  <li>The written portion should contain two distinct, realistic tests that show the functionality of the program.</li>
  <li>The written portion should include very distinct screenshots of the list, where it is called, the procedure, where it is called, and any other described evidence that is necessary for the grade.</li>
</ul>
