            "content": "Daily Posts . Every day this week, starting from when I had to restart the Fastpages site on Monday due to an issue with the setup pull request, I have made a blog post with Markdown to demonstrate both fluency with this type of file and to organize my work across each weekday. . These can all be found on the home page of the site, as well as by being searched for. They are named “Day 1,” “Day 2,” “Day 3,” and so on. Posts are not made on weekends (see “Day 5” for why). . “Day 4” contains an image at the top with a caption to fit a certain Hack. . New Pages . As was suggested as one of the Hacks, I’ve made two new pages on the top bar: “Notes” and “Quizzes and More.” . “Notes” . The “Notes” page contains links to various pages on the site which justify the site’s academic utility. Various pages of notes will be found here. . Focus and Habits Notes . As requested as a part of this week’s schedule, I watched through the “Psychology and the Good Life” speech by Laurie Santos and took notes what it said about happiness, stress, and healthy habits. . To meet the Hack regarding posting a .docx file through the ‘_word’ folder, the notes have been typed in Google Docs and exported as a Word file to put on the site. . Week 1 Python Notes . This notes page goes over some Python commands taught in the “Python Hello” page earlier this week. They are shown in action by mixing Markdown and Python cells in the Jupyter Notebook file. Within these Python cells are captions using # to explain what is being done. These aspects fit the expectations of multiple Hacks. . I also included some other commands I learned about on my own through independent research. . “Quizzes and More” . This is where I put some random non-post projects. Most of what is found in there contributes to specific Hacks, though some, like the Random Number Generator, were just made for fun. . Week 1 Python Quiz . The “Python Hello” page we read through earlier in the week included a Hack asking the reader to make his or her own Python quiz, including a percentage score at the end. . Though the quiz does not actually run on the site, the outputs for all correct inputs can be seen beneath the Python code window. . To stop the quiz from being completely plagiar-inspired, I only reused necessary aspects of the original format and the defined question_and_response command. I added some additional things to prove fluency, such as a custom name input question (which lets the bot call you by a name of your choice throughout the quiz), a progress report three questions into the quiz (with a unique response depending on how many you got right), a percentage score at the end which determines whether or not you passed (you need at least 4/5 or 80% to pass), and an additional Easter egg if you named yourself Drew and got every question correct. This was a lot of fun to make. . Tool Check with Bash . Later in the week, we were asked to use Bash to prove that we have all the necessary tools for the course. Instead of describing everything, I’ll let the page speak for itself. You can click the hyperlink on the title of this section or the “Quizzes and More” page on the top bar to access. . Random Number Generator . For fun, I made a random number generator using the random.randrange command. I thought it would be fun if the random number could cause different results based on what it was, so I gave an option for the RNG host (who I just named Python) to offer a second random number. If the numbers match (a 1/256 chance), Python will tell the user a secret. If the numbers are within 10 integer values of each other, the Python will remark that it was close, but not quite. Don’t you dare cheat and read the secret in the code! . Objectives and Hacks Completed This Week . Notes and presentation through Fastpages | New _pages categories | Focus and Habits notes | Published .docx file | “Python Hello” Notes with… | Mix of Markdown and Python cells | Use of # in cells to add commentary | Custom Python Quiz with percentage score plus extra content | Verify tools with Bash | This Review Ticket | .",

            "content": "Commands from &quot;Python Hello&quot; . In this section, I will put the commands found in &quot;Python Hello&quot; in terms that are easy for someone who has been coding for, say, one week to understand. . Print and Static Text . The &quot;print&quot; command can be used to output static text. . print(&quot;This is the static text produced.&quot;) print(&quot;It can be found within the quotation marks in the parentheses.&quot;) . This is the static text produced. It can be found within the quotation marks in the parentheses. . You can also add variables to the printed static text with the &quot;+&quot; symbol. . x = 5 + 3 print(&quot;The sum of 5 and 3 is &quot; + str(x) + &quot;.&quot;) . The sum of 5 and 3 is 8. . This is just scratching the surface. . &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; . The &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; commands can make certain things happen under certain conditions. . Instead of giving a copius amount of examples, just know that anything you can make happen unconditionally with Python can be restricted to occur under only certain situations with &quot;if.&quot; How to handle the remaining cases is determined by &quot;else,&quot; which doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be present. . x = 4 * 3 # Remember to use a colon at the end of the &quot;if&quot; statement to activiate the condition. if x == 12: print(&quot;Four times three is 12.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Something went wrong.&quot;) # We use &quot;else&quot; above for when x is equal to something different. . Four times three is 12. . But why does it matter that we can do that? How can &#39;x&#39; be equal to anything other than 12 with the set factors of 3 and 4? . Input . Input allows the person interacting with the code to type in a custom response to a prompt. . from tkinter import Y x = input(&quot;What is your favorite number?&quot;) # Fastpages does not allow one to input a response in the actual page. # For the sake of demonstration, &#39;x&#39; has been set to equal 5. # The syntax looks like this if you want a separately printed question and response. print(&quot;What is your other favorite number?&quot;) y = input() # The variable &#39;y&#39; has been set to equal 3. # Now the &quot;if&quot; command will vary based on what we said. z = int(x) * int(y) if z == 12: print(&quot;The product of your favorite numbers is 12.&quot;) else: print(&quot;The product of your favorite numbers is not 12.&quot;) . What is your other favorite number? The product of your favorite numbers is not 12. . Extra Learning . Here are some extra commands and functions I found out about on my own. They can be very helpful in tandem with the rest of these functions. . &quot;elif&quot; . This adds an additional condition to an &quot;if&quot; command. It goes between &quot;if&quot; and &quot;else&quot; vertically. . x = input(&quot;What is your favorite number?&quot;) y = input(&quot;What is your second favorite number?&quot;) z = int(x) * int(y) if z == 12: print(&quot;The product of your favorite numbers is 12.&quot;) elif z == 15: print(&quot;The product of your favorite numbers is 15.&quot;) else: print(&quot;The product of your favorite numbers is not 12 or 15.&quot;) . The product of your favorite numbers is 15. . Algebra . All the algebra stuff above was not taught in the lesson. I figured it out on my own. . &quot;+&quot; = Addition | &quot;-&quot; = Subtraction | &quot;*&quot; = Multiplication | &quot;/&quot; = Division | &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;&quot; = Less Than or Greater Than (often for &#39;if&#39; conditions) | &quot;=&quot; = Equating a value/string | .",

            "content": "More Hacks from This Week . Remember Day 4? Maybe not. Here were the three things I set out to do by the end of today: . Create a page from a “.docx” file with Google Docs. | A page with vocabulary and notes from the “Psychology and the Good Life” speech by Laurie Santos. | (Optional, not for class) A fun little survey idea I had. | . Let’s go over what I ended up doing. . Psychology and the Good Life Notes . I was initially planning to focus on vocabulary presented in the video and how to apply it, but it ended up being almost completely devoid of any particular “vocabulary.” Instead, though I did have a definition for the “GI Joe Fallacy,” I ended up just taking some general notes from the video. . The whole reason for the “vocabulary” aspect was a certain note in various Hacks and objectives about using my site to collect and define vocabulary. . I hadn’t really considered that I already basically did that with Python in my notes from about day ago. I think I’m safe to put that goal to rest for now. . Trying .docx Files . The formatting of the notes is quite visibly different. This is because it was initially a Google Doc converted to a Microsoft Word file. To fit a certain Hack, I put it in the _word folder and let it automatically become a post. . The only problem with this is that I am unable to take it out of the “Posts” list as far as I’m aware. I cannot add front matter to the .docx file so I cannot use hide: true. Otherwise, the formatting is unique and interesting. I’m not sure if I’d willingly go back to this format in the future. . Change of Plans . Initially, I planned on making the Day 5 post a Word document rather than the Focus and Habits notes, but ultimately it made more sense to take notes in a format I’m more used to. Disregard what I implied in my Day 4 conclusion. . This Weekend? . It was a busy day, so I never got to make the for-fun survey. I’ll probably mess around over the weekend and do it. . Since I started from scratch this Monday, there’s no precedent set for posting on weekends. Do I plan on making Day 6 on Saturday and 7 on Sunday? . No. I’ve spent time considering it, but especially after what was discussed in the Focus and Habits video, I’d like to balance my time to spend most of my weekends with friends and family rather than doing gratuitous amounts of school work. . I’ll make my Review Ticket to show everything I’ve done as soon as possible and be done there. . See you next week! .",

            "content": "Laurie Santos: Psychology and the Good Life . At the Aspen Ideas Festival . Taken from a .docx file . Students are often so stressed and busy that they feel they lack the time to do things that supplement their education like reading . At Yale, around a third are so depressed “it’s difficult to function,” 40% report feeling hopeless and over 60% report crippling anxiety . | . | Including healthy habits as a suggestion in a class syllabus managed to greatly increase interest in the class and actually was followed by Yale students . | About 50% of our happiness is not inherited; we have the power to affect 50% of our happiness if we set out to . | Life circumstances matter significantly less to our happiness than people think . People who have a terrible event occur to them tend to see more meaning in life . | . | Improving our happiness through behaviors (about 40% of happiness controlled by this) takes a lot of hard, consistent effort . | GI Joe Fallacy: Knowing is not half the battle, it’s a lot less; following through is more . | Our intuitions lie to us about what will make us happy . Having more money, for example, would increase our happiness because it generally means more stability, but the increase in happiness is not even close to linear as money increases . Happiness bump from $10k -&gt; $20k salary is vastly larger than $75k -&gt; $85k . | . | . | Prioritizing the people they care about is a very important part of living a happy life . People on a train asked to try to make a connection with a stranger on the train were much happier than those who were asked to keep to themselves . The solitude people would normally spend the time trying to do some work and failing to really accomplish anything, which led to frustration; those who talked with others took away something meaningful . | . | . | Helping others can greatly increase your happiness . A study showed that people who spent free money on themselves were much less happy both immediately and after a week than those who spent it on another . | . | Doing simple things to improve your physical health is significantly more effective at causing happiness than people realize . 30 minutes of cardio can have the same effect as taking Zoloft . | Getting proper sleep (high schoolers get 4-5 hours) can greatly improve mood, not just immune system . People getting as much sleep as high school students even for a short experimental time ended up having mood levels low enough to be considered clinically depressed . | . | . | One strong way to improve mood is to live more in the present rather than being absorbed by anxiety about the future . This also means staying in the moment when doing something unpleasurable rather than dreaming of a more pleasurable time . | Just being aware of your present situation helps you appreciate all the good . | Meditating even 10 minutes a day is enough to greatly improve your mood . | . | Prioritizing (leisure) time over money generally causes one to be happier . | . Now I have the knowledge…but this is far less than half the battle. . Ways I Can Improve my Mood (things I’m not already doing): . Pay more attention to friends and family, making sure to take advantage of opportunities to spend time together when possible . | Help others with things whenever possible . Will be a lot easier when WHAT Center starts . | . | Get back into an exercise routine, half an hour at least each day . | Set bedtime of 11:00 on days that homework allows, which will be easier to follow if I… . | Live in the moment to stay focused on less pleasurable things, like taking notes on a psychology video (ouch, sorry) . | When treating myself, focus on all of the enjoyable aspects about my situation . | .",

            "title": "Day 4",
            "content": ". Some Fun Hacks . There are quite a few ways to express understanding of the learning this week through my site. This may be a blog, but it’s also a place for me to collect my thoughts. Maybe these thoughts will reflect the effort and devotion I have to this class. . I’m having fun. I don’t say it often. . Python Quiz . I technically finished the quiz at some point on Day 3, but Day 4 was when everything was finalized and certain “Python Hello” hack goals (percentage score) were met. . I wanted to go above and beyond “plagiar-inspiration,” so anything I was “plagiar-inspired” by has been edited to a degree to prove I understand the reason the functions behind it work. For example, the def command paired with question_and_response usually spat out a slightly different reaction to inputs, which I changed to fit the more casual, personal tone of my own quiz. . Obviously, every question from “Python Hello” has been changed, though the subject matter is the same. There are now five questions. At the beginning, instead of using the getpass.getuser command to call the quiz-taker by his or her often inaccurate system username, I make the quiz ask for the quiz-taker’s name directly, which will be reused throughout. . (If you name yourself “Drew,” the code knows who you must be…) . To show proper understanding if commands (as well as independent research on elif commands), I put a score check two questions before the end which detects your score and gives a completely different response depending on the current number of correct responses. . If you score more than 60.0% (4/5 or 5/5), the quiz determines that you have passed. Otherwise, you have failed. . The quiz is now out on the site, though it’s only the code and outputs for the correct inputs. . Messing with ‘_pages’ . Hey, look at the top bar of the site! Check out those two new categories: “Notes” and “Quizzes and More.” That’s right, these new pages link directly to relevant resources. Please look forward to seeing updates to these pages. . (“Quizzes and More” generally don’t work on the Fastpages site directly. They run perfectly well in VSCode.) . This was a Hack on one of the APCSP instruction pages. . Python Notes . In the “Notes” section, you can find a link to a page full of notes about Python, specifically commands taught on the “Python Hello” page. . Though I have already mostly proven my understanding of those teachings with my Python Quiz and its fairly fluent use of those resources, I figured this would be a good opportunity to complete one of the other Hacks: mix Markdown and Code in a Jupyter Notebooks post and use # in Code cells to add commentary to visible code. I made sure to do both of these things multiple times throughout the page. . Page Relocation . Instead of keeping the Python Quiz and Random Number Generator on the main page with the rest of these posts, I have moved them both to the “Quizzes and More” section. Feel free to access them with the provided hyperlinks. . Bash and Showing my Stuff . As instructed in class, I used Bash to show the tools I have downloaded. The page used to exclusively found through “Search,” but you can also find it linked here and in the “Quizzes and More” page. . Plan for Day 5 . Here is the main place for thought collection. There are a few Hacks I have not fulfilled that I want to make sure to tomorrow: . Create a page from a “.docx” file with Google Docs. Maybe I’ll make Day 5’s post with that format… | A page with vocabulary and notes from the “Psychology and the Good Life” speech by Laurie Santos. This can be put in the “Notes” section. | In free time for fun: just a little survey! Instead of using a ratio of questions to correct answers to score, it will be a multiple choice survey with different percent increases and decreases depending on which response sucks the least. I’ll go into the math more if I end up making it (probably this weekend, after Day 5; we can talk about it on Day 6). | . Thanks for reading! .",

            "content": "Squashing Bugs and New Ideas . After writing my daily post yesterday, I ended up working on making a quiz of my own (since it was listed under “Hacks” in the Python quiz page) and failed to make it work correctly. Because I did not understand the “input” Python function, all answers, correct or not, reacted as if they were incorrect. . With slightly more Python knowledge, I went to bed that night knowing I could definitely improve my old random number generator from Monday. So… . The Python Quiz . At first, yesterday, I started making a survey without even knowing it was a potential Hack for the week. The whole joke was going to be that it said there were no right or wrong answers, but only certain responses were “correct.” Just a little goofy thing. I wasn’t able to create the semi-diverse range of responses that would be based on anticipated answers because I was pretty tunnel-visioned into what was provided in that page. Later, I decided to do some independent research. . I then saw the tip to make a quiz about Python functions and reworked the survey. Plagiar-inspired by the Python quiz’s defined “question_and_answer” and “question_and_response” functions, I used the same basic template to make my own quiz that’s just a bit more personal. I decided to express my icnreasing fluency by asking for the user’s name (which is reused throughout the quiz), giving a status check halfway through the quiz, and determining whether or not the user failed based on their score. As was mentioned in the Hacks, I also used math to calculate the score percentage based on the ratio of correct answers to questions. . Work on this quiz is not quite finished. Please stay tuned for its full release. . The Random Number Generator . My random number generator can now be reset and retried as many times as the user wants. I decided, since I gave Python a defined identity the first time around, I would really lean into it by giving his dialogue a strange, quirky style. Like the first time, I also kept the option to generate a second random number for the user to get lucky. . However, this time, Python recognizes if the second generated number is the same as the first. As he says, he’ll share a secret with you if you manage to generate the same number twice…and no peeking in the code! . I even used some more complex math mixed with ‘if’ and ‘and’ functions to make Python give a special response if the two numbers are relatively close to each other, but not quite the same. . Have fun with that! You can access it right now. . What’s Coming Up? . I’m really just gonna focus on completing Hacks tasks from the APCSP fastpages as well as the Python quiz. As the RNG machine may imply, I have spent a minute or two minutes or half an hour or more messing with code for my own amusement, but as a fairly busy weekend approaches, I’ll make sure to buckle down. . More to come! Stay tuned… .",

Welcome to Drew&#39;s super awesome (slightly plagiar-inspired) Python quiz! You will be asked 5 questions about basic Python commands. All quiz responses should be in all lowercase letters. Before we begin, what would you like me to call you? ? That&#39;s a cool name! 1. Let&#39;s start with the simplest function of all: how can you make Python display static text? You said: . Not quite... The response we were looking for was &#39;print&#39;. 2. When using the &#39;if&#39; function to force a unique reaction for a specific scenario, which function lets you give a different response for ALL other answers? You said: . Nope... Looks like you&#39;ll have to try something ELSE for that one. 3. This three-letter function can redefine a phrase to automate certain behaviors when used. What is it? You said: . That&#39;s DEF-initely not it... Let&#39;s see how you&#39;re doing so far, ... Really? None? ...I mean, you&#39;ve got two more chances to get some points on the board... 4. Which function allows the user to provide a custom response to a given prompt? You said: . Unfortunately, you seem to have INPUT an incorrect response. 5. The home stretch! To display a variable, for example, in printed static text, which symbol separates the variable from the rest of the quote? You said: . Rough conclusion...definitely not a PLUS. , you scored 0/5! That&#39;s 0.0%. Too bad, though! You needed at least 4 out of 5 (80.0%) of the problems correct to pass. Why not reload and try again? .",

            "content": "Independent Endeavors . It takes a lot of investment in a class for me to go out of my way to apply my knowledge in ways not enforced by the teacher or class. Maybe computer science is my thing. . Research . Over summer, I spent some time looking over the things you could do with Python. One thing I always wanted to make for some strange reason was a random number generator. . From a mathematical standpoint, I have always been fascinated by the concept of probability. Given things like the butterfly effect and the way that various microscopic events and processes manipulate free will, even humans cannot truly create randomness. Unfortunately, computers really can’t either, but they can do their very best to replicate it. . I looked around on Google in my very minimal free time and found the “rand.integer” and “rand.range” commands. This is enough to create the basic RNG code I set out to. . What’s the point of a random number generator? . Ultimately, I want to use this RNG to add an element of unpredictability to my site. Maybe, after setting a variable, using “If” commands will allow me to create certain images, phrases, words, etc. based on which number is generated. Messing with which numbers do what and the possible range of generated numbers could make certain events more likely than others. . I also really like the concept of adding little Easter eggs for people who interact with the site. Maybe if you click on certain pages and get lucky, something goofy or unexpected appears. . There’s just a lot of fun to be had with unpredictability. . Current Obstacles . So I made a random number generator that works perfectly in the code of my website…but not on the website itself. . When the page reloads, the generated numbers stay the same. I think the only way I can make the generator work as intended is if I make a button to click and let it run a new generation. I don’t know how to do this at the moment, and a small amount of research hasn’t led to much. . More to come! .",

            "content": "The Early Trouble . The first days . Figuring it was homework to do so, I downloaded all of the programs listed in the Tools and Setup page and saved the fastpages part for the next day. This step would be a permanent help, even after the fastpages site had to be reset. . The problem that would lead to the loss of my admittedly little progress was evident from the very beginning: that Thurday, even after following all the steps listed in the first pull request, I had either forgotten to resolve the request or something had prevented me from doing so. Either way, by the next day, it seemed that there was no way to resolve the request, causing my website to look far less professional than other students’ I had seen. It’s surprising how much a lack of proper UI can make a site go from a 2022 professional business site to a 2008 fan site. . Showing off . I tried to make some bold and italicized text in my About Me section, but the site bug made it impossible for the link redirects to work. Headers worked on the home page but subheaders did not. A notebook post making use of the Python “print” command was created as well, but the same issue with the About Me page existed. . The Solution . Two words: Thanos snap. . Well, more accurately, none of my previous repository history had been deleted, but I did have to start the fastpages creation process from scration. . There’s a reason I called it a Thanos snap, though: the fastpages issues were competely separate from the rest of the work I had put into downloading the tools. This means that only the time I had put into the initial drew2 fastpages setup was a waste. That time was very quickly made up; setup took noticeably longer. . Now, everything looks perfect. Turns out the problem was, as implied earlier, pertaining to the unresolved pull request from the very beginning. An unresolvable issue was found in one of the Jupyter files (still not sure exacly what the deal was with that) but it doesn’t matter now, this site is pure and new and is brimming with potential. . Why not bring over the previous progress to this new site? . That would be because my old edits were mostly cries for help to the github gods to fix my broken website. It would be a little bit strange to have that on a perfectly sound, as-intended site. . Plus, with just this content, I already have a lot more done. I have a lot more progress to talk about and a lot of hindsight to document. Might as well start documentation from scratch along with the site. . Anticipations . It looks like we’ll expand upon our knowledge of Python this week. I’m exicted to use it to do funny things. . I’d really like to use a random number generator to make a page on my website which is different every time you load it. I’m not exactly sure how yet, but I’m sure it’s possible. Why not boost my aspirations? .",
