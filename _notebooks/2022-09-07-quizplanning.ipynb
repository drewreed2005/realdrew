    "# What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a quiz. But what's the topic?\n",
    "\n",
    "After some deliberation, I've decided on Pokémon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Pokémon?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, at first I decided on SpongeBob, since I know a lot about that too. However, Pokémon is a gold mine of interesting trivia, whereas a SpongeBob quiz would mostly boil down to \"Have you seen this episode?\" or \"Did you catch this tiny detail?\" Where, at first, I would think \"What is Mr. Krabs's middle initial?\" for Spongebob (it's \"H.\", by the way), with Pokémon, I could ask \"What did the MissingNo. glitch NOT do to your save file?\" or \"What was the first Pokémon ever designed?\" or \"What is the first Pokémon in the Generation 5 Pokédex?\" So many interesting questions...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Brainstorming Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the non-code part, so I won't spend an hour explaining why I asked what I did. I will say, however, that no questions about the Pokémon anime series have been asked, and I have made sure to include some trivia about each of the eight Pokémon generations (currently). Here they are in the form of a list (no answers for you!):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What was the first Pokémon design ever created? (Pikachu, Rhydon, Clefairy, or Bulbasaur?)\n",
    "2. What is the canonical name of the Pokémon Red and Blue protagonist? (Ash, Satoshi, Red, or Blue?)\n",
    "3. What are some properties of the famous Generation 1 glitch Pokémon \"MissingNo.\"? (The number of items in the sixth bag slot increases by 128 after the encounter, your Hall of Fame data is corrupted after the encounter, it can be encountered indefinitely, or its appearance and forms can be altered based on your Trainer ID?)\n",
    "4. How many new Pokémon were added to Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal? (100, 151, 200, or 79?)\n",
    "5. How many Gym Leaders/Elite Four members (including Champion Lance) use at least one new Johto Pokémon in Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal? (5/13, 8/13, 10/13, or 12/13?)\n",
    "6. Which of these instruments is considered *most* prominent in the soundtrack of Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald? (Trumpet, Saxophone, Violin, or Guitar?)\n",
    "7. In Pokémon Emerald, when Wallace replaced Steven Stone as the Champion of Hoenn, who took Wallace's place in the Sootopolis Gym? (Misty, Juan, Captain, or Mr. Briney?)\n",
    "8. ~~In the Generation 3 Kanto remakes \"Pokémon FireRed\" and \"Pokémon LeafGreen,\" which of these areas CANNOT be found on the Sevii Islands? (Navel Rock, Water Labyrinth, Dotted Hole, or Sword Coast?)~~\n",
    "9. Which of these aspects are the Generation 4 Pokémon games NOT known for? (Slow battle speed, new evolutions of old Pokémon, many Legendary and Mythical Pokémon, or Easy Difficulty?)\n",
    "10. The Pokéwalker (an accessory to the Johto remakes \"Pokémon HeartGold\" and \"Pokémon SoulSilver\") was notable for which of these aspects? (Being a particularly accurate pedometer, being difficult to obtain upon release, allowing players to capture exclusive Mythical Pokémon, or being incredibly resiliant/hard to break?)\n",
    "11. Pokémon Black and Pokémon White were NOT the first games in the series to do which of the following things? (Make a regional Pokédex of exclusively new Pokémon, divide physical and special moves based on context rather than type, animate 2D Pokémon sprites throughout battle, or use human vocals in the soundtrack?)\n",
    "12. ~~Which of these features was first added in \"Pokémon Black Version 2\" and \"Pokémon White Version 2\" (the sequels to Pokémon Black and White)? (Triple Battles, Rotation Battles, the Pokémon World Tournament, or Hidden Abilities?)~~\n",
    "13. Which of these sets of legendaries have the same battle theme as each other? (Ho-oh and Lugia; Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza; Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina; or Zekrom, Reshiram and Kyurem?)\n",
    "14. For the first time since Generation 2, a new type was added in Generation 6! What was it? ('Light', 'Sound', 'Fairy', or '???')\n",
    "15. Which of these factors did NOT contribute to \"Pokémon X\" and \"Pokémon Y\" being some of the easiest games in the series? (Gym Leaders' lack of full teams and movesets, the introduction of Mega Evolutions, heavily decreased item prices, or the EXP Share applying to the whole party?)\n",
    "16. ~~Which feature from Pokémon Emerald was NOT carried over to the remakes \"Pokémon Omega Ruby\" and \"Pokémon Alpha Sapphire\"? (The Battle Frontier, the Battle Chateau, Pokémon Contests, or the Wynaut egg?)~~\n",
    "17. Which of these mechanics were introduced in \"Pokémon Sun\" and \"Pokémon Moon\"? (Z-Moves, Totem Pokémon, Regional Variants, or all of the above?)\n",
    "18. ~~Which new shiny hunting technique was introduced in \"Pokémon Ultra Sun\" and \"Pokémon Ultra Moon\" (the sequels to Pokémon Sun and Moon)? (S.O.S. chaining, Island Scan hunting, Wormhole hunting, or horde hunting?)~~\n",
    "19. ~~Before the Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra DLC, how many Pokémon of the 905 total that existed could be obtained in \"Pokémon Sword\" and \"Pokémon Shield\"? (251, 400, 551, or 630?)~~\n",
    "20. Which of these Generation 8 Legendary Pokémon went on to be banned to the \"AG\" tier, the highest possible tier in Pokémon? (Zacian, Zamazenta, Eternatus, or Calyrex?)\n",

    "The only reason there are completely separate screens to differentiate between a correct response and an incorrect one (`question[#]answer` and `question[#]wrong`) is that I had planned on writing separate text for each of those slides. As is the case for multiple elements of this quiz (the 20 original questions, an ambitious planned free-response segment, etc.), what ultimately got in the way was tedium. It simply didn't feel like adding those things would really improve the *purpose* of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trivia was already mostly difficult. I *know* I could make an awesome, super complicated quiz if I wanted to, but it just didn't feel like there was much of a point to it. I could have created a bank of more questions to give the quiz some variance (like my survey from last week), created a function to generate a random number, checked prevoiusly generated numbers with a `for` loop, and then have 15-20 randomly-selected, non-repeating questions. But why? It serves its purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, I'm a perfectionist. A very adamant one. If it would fix some sort of bug in the program, I definitely would go back and make your score imcrement upon clicking the correct answer, then consolidate the two screens into a single `question[#]answer` screen on which I used `showElement` to display \"That's right!\" or \"Not quite!\" depending on the previous response. I know that would be just slightly more efficient...but efficiency wasn't exactly a problem to begin with.\n",

Considering the for-fun Python program I'm making right now, I'm already tempted to use it to make a little turn-based battle system, maybe even directly replicating the Pokémon battle formula, with a back sprite on your end and a front sprite on theirs. Maybe you're battling the Champion with his full team of six and you need to find a way to win with a not-so-good team of your own. Who knows? There's lots that can be done.\n",
