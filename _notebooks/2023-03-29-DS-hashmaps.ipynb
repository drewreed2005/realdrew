    "\n",
    "> A hashtable is a data structure that has a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a <mark>dictionary</mark>.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The typical time complexity of a hashtable is <mark>O(1), or constant</mark>. \n"

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",

    "### My Favorite Taylor Swift Song\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't need ChatGPT to help me argue in favor of \"Teardrops On My Guitar\". To be completely honest, I've never been a fan of the more recent Taylor Swift music, though that's mostly due to the genre. It's nothing personal. I also wouldn't say I'm a fan of country by any means, but, especially in my more recent personal life, country music has adopted a sort of nostalgic value.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "This song has quite literally followed me through my life. Being released on her 2006 self-titled debut album \"Taylor Swift,\" it (along with her first single \"Tim McGraw\") earned her some of her first share of popularity. It was cowritten by Liz Rose, who received a Songwriter of the Year award from Society of European Stage Authors and Composers the following year for her work on these two singles. In an interview about the song, Rose talked about how Swift was good at expressing the emotions she wished to portray in the song to her. Rose made it very clear that she was not stepping in or creating a corporate, filtered expression of Swift's idea, as she wanted Swift to \"be the vehicle.\" It was produced by Nathan Chapman, known for his work on many other early Taylor Swift songs as well as other artists like Lady Antebellum and, more recently, Revival.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know this song well enough, you know I'm failing to address a big elephant in the room. The elephant's name is \"Drew.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For my whole life, my family has, mockingly or not, sung this song around me, played it in the car, etc. \"Drew looks at me\" was a lyric that wrapped itself around my brain fairly often. My dad bought her debut album on iTunes just so that they could play it in my mom's old van, which couldn't play music from my dad's phone unless it was saved through iTunes. When I picked up guitar, my parent said it was the first song I should learn. My girlfriend, an avid Taylor Swift and country fan, referenced it not long after I met her. If it's not clear, I have a lot of personal associations with this song.\n",
    "\n",
    "And speaking of playing it on guitar, it's a very easy song to learn if you strip it of all of the complicated bits. The fact that it comes with so many potential variations to learn, though, like the somewhat melancholy Dsus4 chord in the second verse and the various pinky-finger add-ons that you can choose to play.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's lots of other stuff I could talk about with this song, like how the actual \"Drew\" is actually named \"Andrew,\" like me. Or how the \"Drew\" from the song is now in jail for child abuse, while, fun fact, I'm not. But I think I'll leave it at that. I'm not trying to convince you to change your mind on your favorite. But now, if you ever hear that song again, you might think of me. And I think that's funny."
