    "#### How it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "I know it's pretty complicated and I didn't make any code comments, but here's how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made four functions for convenience, two being ones I already made (though one was just in Python before): `DecimalToBinary()`, which converts a decimal input to 8-bit binary; `BinaryToDecimal()`, which converts an 8-bit binary input to decimal; `AddressToBinary()`, which converts an IP address or subnet mask from decimal to binary; and `AddressToDecimal()`, which converts an IP address or subnet mask from binary to decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `NetAddressConvert()` function that satisfies the conditions of the assignment takes a decimal IP address and decimal subnet mask (in any order) as parameters, converts them to binary, then procedurally creates the network address by checking (using `&&`) if both bits at a certain index on the IP and subnet mask are \"1\" (adding a \"1\" if true), and if they aren't, it adds a \"0\" to the network address. Where there are periods in the IP, to ensure the same formatting, a period is placed in the network address.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above uses 251.84.0.1 as the IP address and 255.255.255.0 as the subnet mask. The program works with all other IP addresses and subnet masks, however, as long as they stay within the legitimate bounds of 8-bit binary."
