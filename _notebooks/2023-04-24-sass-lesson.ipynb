    "## Why SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "SASS is an improvement on CSS in that there are methods of abstraction. It is a **stylesheet** language that is **compiled** into CSS, which means that **Sass will translate the Sass code you wrote into CSS**, which is what your web browser can read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SASS vs SCSS\n",
    "As you learn about Sass, you might notice something called Scss. They are basically the same thing except that Scss uses curly braces and semicolons to distinguish between lines. Sass uses indentation and newlines instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be teaching the Scss syntax because it is more commonly used."

    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "A easy way to write SASS and have it preprocessed into CSS is by using a Jekyll powered website, such as GitHub pages or Fastpages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to clone a GitHub pages repo, such as this [one](https://github.com/lwu1822/sassy_squad).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the repository, head over to `assets/css/`, and open `style.scss`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you can create your SASS code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see your CSS-translated SASS code, head over to `_site/assets/css/style.css`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You will need to run bundle exec jekyll serve before the _site directory appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first few hundred lines are used to style Github's theme. Make sure to scroll to the very bottom to see the SASS code that you wrote, which is in the form of CSS."
