    "Doing this made me realize that sometimes, the procedural, non-object-oriented method we learned in class today is just easier. The classes were a lot to juggle, and I found myself really struggling to jump between the two different methods.\n",

    "## Procedural Abstraction Question\n",
    "\n",
    "We were tasked to answer where procedural abstraction can be seen in our new databases. In mine, it can very easily be seen all throughout the process, starting with the `Comment` and `Enemy` class functions and ending with the `forum` function. In each case, I created new functions to prevent other functions from becoming too bulky or difficult to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I made sure that the primary focus of `verify` was to log the user in before making a comment. Then, I had it transition into the `make_comment` function when it was time for that step in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also used it for `e_read` so that I could grab the up-to-date enemy table data in an easy-to-manipulate JSON format whenever I needed to in other functions, including `make_comment` and `forum`. I think this was some pretty valuable foresight."
