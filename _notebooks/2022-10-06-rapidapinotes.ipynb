    "On RapidAPI, I found some data taken from [speedrun.com](speedrun.com), the internet's primary speedrunning forum site and hub for video game speedrunning world records.\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, speedrunning is the practice of attempting to beat or complete certain goals in video games as fast as possible. This can be a challenge as minor as buying Mario some boxers to wear in Super Mario Odyssey (Nipple%) or as gargantuan as completing every shrine and side quest in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (BotW 100%); and it can be as short as just over a minute (Pokémon Red and Blue any%) and as long as multiple days (in segments with certain restrictions).\n",
    "\n",
    "This API included a LOT of data, so I decided it would be best to curate it based on user input so that it wasn't TOO bloated. Plus, this shows additional fluency with reading and displaying `json`-ified data."
