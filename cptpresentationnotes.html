<p>They started with purpose and audience for their program. Their program would be to keep track of school clubs.</p>

<p>They then gave two goals for their program so that we know what their ultimate goal is. This helps us see where they were going.</p>

<p>They then went over the wireframe for their site. Afterward, they showed how they’d use CRUD in conjunction with the school club database.</p>

<p>They accounted for many specific things that would be potential problems with their idea, such as the possibility of spam on their database and who would have access (ASB).</p>

<p>Throughout, they addressed certain challenges that would come with their program. This showed awareness.</p>

<p>At the end, they had every group member show off what they would do by each week of the process. They had this information also fully organized into a SCRUM Board, then showed off their AGILE Manifesto.</p>

<p>They first showed a wireframe of their website’s home page. They then showed a visual representation of how data would be sent to and read from the database.</p>

<p>In their presentation, they provided multiple instances where they would show (numerically) “WHAT?” a certain part of the program would be, “HOW?” it would work, and “WHY?” it was important.</p>

<p>At the end, they used a UML diagram to show how accessing the website would lead to certain increments on the database.</p>

<p>Our original idea, Cafe Gato, is a website for a (not real) cat cafe. The purpose of our whole website is to represent an ideal online website marketing campaign for a theoretical cat cafe. (The fact that it is a cat cafe is someone incidental. It could be another kind of site. The reason we chose a cat cafe is that is shows how <em>theming</em> could be used in such a campagin.)</p>

<p>We plan on adding these features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A food review option which allows people who visited the restaurant to leave reviews on the food directly on our site (with a five-star rating scale.)
    <ul>
      <li>The entries will be stored in a database. You will be able to filter by stars.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An events creation form which lets users schedule events in the events room of the cafe.
    <ul>
      <li>Certain validation requirements will be set such that the same person will not be able to schedule many spam events, schedule events on invalid dates or at invalid times, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A games page on which users can play games for certain discounts.
    <ul>
      <li>A Wordle-esque game with a new word every day.
        <ul>
          <li>Solving the Wordle and coming in with it lets you get a slight discount. It isn’t a large one so as to not impede business or profit.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A Cat RPG where speedrunning gets you better and better times on the leaderboard.
        <ul>
          <li>Coming in with a top 10 score can give you certain discounts is the current idea.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
