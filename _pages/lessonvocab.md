### [3.1 (Variables and Assignments)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections1-2notes/#Variables-and-Assignments)

Variables: abstractions within programs which represent a value

Booleans: a binary type of data which can be set to "True" or "False (can be output as a result of equality/inequality statements)

### [3.2 (Data Abstraction)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections1-2notes/#Data-Abstraction)

List: a set of elements organized in a specific order (can be infinitely long)

Element: a unique, individual value in a list

Data Abstraction: the storage of data in abstract variables

### [3.3 (Mathematical Expressions)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections3-4notes/#3.3-Mathematical-Expressions)

Algorithm: a set of actions with a set of rules that tells a program what to do

### [3.4 (Strings)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections3-4notes/#3.4-Strings(Show-video-1))

Concatenation: combining strings using `+` (or sometimes `,`)

Length: the amount of elements in a list, characters in a string, etc. depending on the source in question

Substring: individual characters within a string

### [3.5 (Boolean Expressions)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections5-7notes/#3.5-Boolean-Expresssions)

(See "Booleans" in 3.1 vocabulary)

Logical operators:  `and`, `or` and `not`; operators that compare the state of multiple things

### [3.6 (Conditionals)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections5-7notes/#3.6-Conditionals)

(See "Algorithm" in 3.3 vocabulary)

Selection: the process that determines which parts of an algoritm is being executed based on a condition that is true or false

Conditional: reliant upon a certain variable condition to occur

### [3.7 (Nested Conditional Statements)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections5-7notes/#3.7-Nested-Conditional-Statements)

(See "Conditional" in 3.6 vocabulary)

Nested conditionals: conditionals within conditionals

### [3.9 (Developing Algorithms)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections9&11notes/#Developing-Algothims-(Python))

(See "Algorithm" in 3.3 vocabulary)

(See "Booleans" in 3.1 vocabulary)

(See "Conditional" in 3.6 vocabulary)

### [3.11 (Searching)]({{site.baseurl}}/sections9&11notes/#Searching-Introduction)

Sequential Search: a search method that requires a program to look at each instance in a series of information in order (which is generally inefficient compared to Binary Search)

Binary Search: a search method that starts in the middle of a series of information, compares the information found to the target, then recenters with half of the remaining data cut off

Floor division: division that automatically rounds non-integer quotients

### [3.12 Calling Procedures]({{site.baseurl}}/sections12-13notes/#Calling-Procedures-(Python))

Procedure: a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values

Parameters: input values of a procedure, specified by arguments

Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called

### [3.13 Developing Procedures]({{site.baseurl}}/sections12-13notes/#Developing-Procedures)

Modularity: separating a program's functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality

Procedural Abstraction: providing a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it
