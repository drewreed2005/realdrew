Drew panicked over the course of four days because his fastpages website would not load correctly. Commits worked (vaguely) but it was difficult to present edits to pages which only showed 404 errors.

After starting from scratch, it seems like the website is good to go.

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].



[^1]:a blogging platform that natively supports Jupyter notebooks in addition to other formats.
