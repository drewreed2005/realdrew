<p>Here’s what I can learn from the mistakes these students, in all three of the grading notes, made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Though this problem wasn’t as present in this set of examples, make <em>sure</em> that the “Purpose” is stated to be <strong>why</strong> the function of the program even matters, or what that function <strong>does</strong> for the user. DO NOT just state what the program literally does as the “Purpose.”</li>
  <li>Make sure that the use of a list is genuinely important to the complexity of the program. I probably won’t have to worry about this, but don’t just use one because you feel like it when variables would work just as well.</li>
  <li>Make SURE that the selected procedure for Procedural Abstraction has at least one parameter.
    <ul>
      <li>Not having at least one ruins both Procedural Abstraction and Testing, as you need to call the procedure with two different arguments for the point. Speaking of which…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For Testing, make sure that the two tests are simply the procedure in question being called with distinctly different arguments that alter the output of the procedure.</li>
</ul>
