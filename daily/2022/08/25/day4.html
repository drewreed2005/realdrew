<h1 id="some-fun-hacks">
<a class="anchor" href="#some-fun-hacks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Some Fun Hacks</h1>

<p>There are quite a few ways to express understanding of the learning this week through my site. This may be a blog, but it’s also a place for me to collect my thoughts. Maybe these thoughts will reflect the effort and devotion I have to this class.</p>

<p>I’m having fun. I don’t say it often.</p>

<h2 id="python-quiz">
<a class="anchor" href="#python-quiz" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Python Quiz</h2>

<p>I technically finished the quiz at some point on Day 3, but Day 4 was when everything was finalized and certain “Python Hello” hack goals (percentage score) were met.</p>

<p>I wanted to go above and beyond “plagiar-inspiration,”  so anything I was “plagiar-inspired” by has been edited to a degree to prove I understand the reason the functions behind it work. For example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">def</code> command paired with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">question_and_response</code> usually spat out a slightly different reaction to inputs, which I changed to fit the more casual, personal tone of my own quiz.</p>

<p>Obviously, every question from “Python Hello” has been changed, though the subject matter is the same. There are now five questions. At the beginning, instead of using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getpass.getuser</code> command to call the quiz-taker by his or her often inaccurate system username, I make the quiz ask for the quiz-taker’s name directly, which will be reused throughout.</p>

<p>(If you name yourself “Drew,” the code knows who you must be…)</p>

<p>To show proper understanding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> commands (as well as independent research on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">elif</code> commands), I put a score check two questions before the end which detects your score and gives a completely different response depending on the current number of correct responses.</p>

<p>If you score more than 60.0% (4/5 or 5/5), the quiz determines that you have passed. Otherwise, you have failed.</p>

<p>The quiz is now out on the site, though it’s only the code and outputs for the correct inputs.</p>

<h2 id="messing-with-_pages">
<a class="anchor" href="#messing-with-_pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Messing with ‘_pages’</h2>

<p>Hey, look at the top bar of the site! Check out those two new categories: “Notes” and “Quizzes and More.” That’s right, these new pages link directly to relevant resources. Please look forward to seeing updates to these pages.</p>

<p>(“Quizzes and More” generally don’t work on the Fastpages site directly. They run perfectly well in VSCode.)</p>

<p>This was a Hack on one of the APCSP instruction pages.</p>

<h3 id="python-notes">
<a class="anchor" href="#python-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Python Notes</h3>

<p>In the “Notes” section, you can find a link to a page full of notes about Python, specifically commands taught on the “Python Hello” page.</p>

<p>Though I have already mostly proven my understanding of those teachings with my Python Quiz and its fairly fluent use of those resources, I figured this would be a good opportunity to complete one of the other Hacks: mix Markdown and Code in a Jupyter Notebooks post and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> in Code cells to add commentary to visible code. I made sure to do both of these things multiple times throughout the page.</p>

<h3 id="page-relocation">
<a class="anchor" href="#page-relocation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Page Relocation</h3>

<p>Instead of keeping the Python Quiz and Random Number Generator on the main page with the rest of these posts, I have moved them both to the “Quizzes and More” section. Feel free to access them with the provided hyperlinks.</p>

<h2 id="bash-and-showing-my-stuff">
<a class="anchor" href="#bash-and-showing-my-stuff" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bash and Showing my Stuff</h2>

<p>As instructed in class, I used Bash to show the tools I have downloaded. The page used to exclusively found through “Search,” but you can also find it linked <a href="https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/25/bashstuff.html">here</a> and in the “Quizzes and More” page.</p>

<h1 id="plan-for-day-5">
<a class="anchor" href="#plan-for-day-5" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Plan for Day 5</h1>

<p>Here is the main place for thought collection. There are a few Hacks I have not fulfilled that I want to make sure to tomorrow:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a page from a “.docx” file with Google Docs. Maybe I’ll make Day 5’s post with that format…</li>
  <li>A page with vocabulary and notes from the “Psychology and the Good Life” speech by Laurie Santos. This can be put in the “Notes” section.</li>
  <li>In free time for fun: just a little survey! Instead of using a ratio of questions to correct answers to score, it will be a multiple choice survey with different percent increases and decreases depending on which response sucks the least. I’ll go into the math more if I end up making it (probably this weekend, after Day 5; we can talk about it on Day 6).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
