<p>After writing my daily post yesterday, I ended up working on making a quiz of my own (since it was listed under “Hacks” in the Python quiz page) and failed to make it work correctly. Because I did not understand the “input” Python function, all answers, correct or not, reacted as if they were incorrect.</p>

<p>With slightly more Python knowledge, I went to bed that night knowing I could definitely improve my old random number generator from Monday. So…</p>

<h2 id="the-python-quiz">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-python-quiz" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Python Quiz</h2>

<p>At first, yesterday, I started making a survey without even knowing it was a potential Hack for the week. The whole joke was going to be that it said there were no right or wrong answers, but only certain responses were “correct.” Just a little goofy thing. I wasn’t able to create the semi-diverse range of responses that would be based on anticipated answers because I was pretty tunnel-visioned into what was provided in that page. Later, I decided to do some independent research.</p>

<p>I then saw the tip to make a quiz about Python functions and reworked the survey. Plagiar-inspired by the Python quiz’s defined “question_and_answer” and “question_and_response” functions, I used the same basic template to make my own quiz that’s just a bit more personal. I decided to express my icnreasing fluency by asking for the user’s name (which is reused throughout the quiz), giving a status check halfway through the quiz, and determining whether or not the user failed based on their score. As was mentioned in the Hacks, I also used math to calculate the score percentage based on the ratio of correct answers to questions.</p>

<p>Work on this quiz is not quite finished. Please stay tuned for its full release.</p>

<p>My random number generator can now be reset and retried as many times as the user wants. I decided, since I gave Python a defined identity the first time around, I would really lean into it by giving his dialogue a strange, quirky style. Like the first time, I also kept the option to generate a second random number for the user to get lucky.</p>

<p>However, this time, Python recognizes if the second generated number is the same as the first. As he says, he’ll share a secret with you if you manage to generate the same number twice…and no peeking in the code!</p>

<p>I even used some more complex math mixed with ‘if’ and ‘and’ functions to make Python give a special response if the two numbers are relatively close to each other,  but not quite the same.</p>

<p>Have fun with that! You can access it right now.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#whats-coming-up" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What’s Coming Up?</h1>

<p>I’m really just gonna focus on completing Hacks tasks from the APCSP fastpages as well as the Python quiz. As the RNG machine may imply, I have spent a minute or two minutes or half an hour or more messing with code for my own amusement, but as a fairly busy weekend approaches, I’ll make sure to buckle down.</p>

<p>More to come! Stay tuned…</p>
