# This Week's Goals

This week, we were asked to review the CollegeBoard Big Idea 1.1 videos about Collaboration, set up customizeable Fastpages and Python servers in our machines, and watch and take note of the Focus and Habits speech. I have made sure to complete all of these tasks.

# [Fastpages Server and Python Web Server Video](https://youtu.be/POALOn1CRIc)

Click [here](https://youtu.be/POALOn1CRIc) to access the video. In this video, I show the functionality of both of these servers and review the process of making and committing edits to them.

I tried my best to include clips and dialogue which show understanding of what I'm doing and how one could make other, larger edits. One of the suggestions for the video was to encorporate learnings from the Collaboration and Focus and Habits videos, but due to the constraint of the video being roughly 1 minute.

Feel free to leave comments either on this Fastpages post or the liked YouTube video.

# [Big Idea 1 - Collaboration Notes](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/09/18/collaborationnotes.html)

Click [here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/09/18/collaborationnotes.html) to access my notes. I was unable to complete the multiple choice quiz on the CollegeBoard website because I finalized these notes on September 19th, the day we have off of school, and by then, the MCQ was already inaccessible.

To make up for it, I took a pretty solid amount of notes. Rather than just repeating what was in the video, I included some of my own known instances of collaboration in a programming space and connected what I learned to my previous experience in the class.

I'm sure these notes are enough to answer any question on the MCQ.

# [Focus and Habits Notes](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/26/Focus-and-Habits-Notes.html)

Click [here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/26/Focus-and-Habits-Notes.html) to access the notes. In this .docx page, I go over all of the main points discussed in the video more concisely and discuss how I will take (or already have taken) steps to better my experience as a student.

Back a couple weeks ago, the Focus and Habits video was linked as an assignment before being removed later on in the week. As a result, I already took notes on the video a while ago, which is why the date is set a while back on the page.

# Independent Coding

This week, I decided to separate my progress on my independent RPG project onto another repository. Rather than applying what was in my notes to further my progress on the actual story, I ended up mostly focusing on allocating variables and functions to other folders and files in the repository in order to declutter. Having everything concentrated into a single file made it difficult to code.

Separating these things did, at times, cause me trouble. After some significant independent research and learning to make creative use of the `open()` and `write()` commands, I managed to create a menu which allows a player to customize the rate at which characters are output (using the video-game-like `texttype()` or `textscroll()` functions), the duration between the generation of lines, and the color of narration text throughout the game. At first, the values kept being reset to the default, and I figured out that it was because I was calling functions from the `textstuff` file rather than the file in which the variables are changed, which makes the file only read the initial values rather than the edited ones.

I'm also considering how I will incorporate the music in the game. I'm currently in the process of that, and hopefully by next week, I'll have that framework and the framework of the main menu finished.

# List of Objectives Met

- Fastpages local server is up and running, and edits work correctly (see video)
- Python web server is up and running, and has been edited in multiple places (see video)
- Notes have been taken on the Collaboration videos
- Notes have been taken on the Focus and Habits video
- One-minute video has been created to show the first two functions and prove understanding of this week's Career Tech expectations

More to come! Thank you.
