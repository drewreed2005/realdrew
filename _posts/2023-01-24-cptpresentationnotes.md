## Structure

They started with purpose and audience for their program. Their program would be to keep track of school clubs.

They then gave two goals for their program so that we know what their ultimate goal is. This helps us see where they were going.

They then went over the wireframe for their site. Afterward, they showed how they'd use CRUD in conjunction with the school club database.

They accounted for many specific things that would be potential problems with their idea, such as the possibility of spam on their database and who would have access (ASB).

Throughout, they addressed certain challenges that would come with their program. This showed awareness.

At the end, they had every group member show off what they would do by each week of the process. They had this information also fully organized into a SCRUM Board, then showed off their AGILE Manifesto.

### Visual Aspects

They first showed a wireframe of their website's home page. They then showed a visual representation of how data would be sent to and read from the database.

In their presentation, they provided multiple instances where they would show (numerically) "WHAT?" a certain part of the program would be, "HOW?" it would work, and "WHY?" it was important.

At the end, they used a UML diagram to show how accessing the website would lead to certain increments on the database.

## What We Will Present

Our original idea, Cafe Gato, is a website for a (not real) cat cafe. The purpose of our whole website is to represent an ideal online website marketing campaign for a theoretical cat cafe. (The fact that it is a cat cafe is someone incidental. It could be another kind of site. The reason we chose a cat cafe is that is shows how *theming* could be used in such a campagin.)

We plan on adding these features:
- A food review option which allows people who visited the restaurant to leave reviews on the food directly on our site (with a five-star rating scale.)
    - The entries will be stored in a database. You will be able to filter by stars.
- An events creation form which lets users schedule events in the events room of the cafe.
    - Certain validation requirements will be set such that the same person will not be able to schedule many spam events, schedule events on invalid dates or at invalid times, etc.
- A games page on which users can play games for certain discounts.
    - A Wordle-esque game with a new word every day.
        - Solving the Wordle and coming in with it lets you get a slight discount. It isn't a large one so as to not impede business or profit.
    - A Cat RPG where speedrunning gets you better and better times on the leaderboard.
        - Coming in with a top 10 score can give you certain discounts is the current idea.
