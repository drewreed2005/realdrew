# The Team
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/thewatcherslogo.png" alt="Logo" width="400"/>
Our table has decided to go by the name "The Watchers," named after this project. The four of us as a collective will be referred to by this name throughout the post.

## Roles and Weekly Plan

Drew Reed will be playing the role of SCRUM Master, meaning he will manage assignments for each group member, update the SCRUM Board, and oversee the completion of tasks.

Devon Shepherd will be playing the role of Backend Developer. His focus will be on creating the background code (variable management, functions, iteration, etc.).

Jagger Klein will be playing the role of Frontend Developer. His focus is the part of the program that users see, designed using HTML, CSS, etc.

Trent Cardall will be the swing, who will play the role of either Backend Developer or Frontend Developer depending on the goals agreed upon during the weekly/daily meeting.

## SCRUM Board Hack

We have created a SCRUM Board which links to other issues which record the progress during a given week of work. Since the process of creating the program has only just started, it does not have any progress currently. The framework has been prepared for future use.

# "Work Watch"

The "Work Watch" is a customizable timer which runs in the background of a user's work process. Based on the details the user inputs, the timer declares when to take breaks and suggests what the user should do during the break.

## Program Purpose

The purpose of the "Work Watch" is to promote taking short breaks during long bouts of work, which has shown to be beneficial to the quality of work output as well as to mental health.

As Laurie Santos discussed in her speech "Psychology and the Good Life," many students feel as if they do not have enough time to do the things that supplement and improve their education, such as reading and exercising. Our timer will give healthy suggestions for break time activities (such as the previous) to further promote the health of the user.

To make long work sessions less arduous and provide the user a sense of progress, he or she will be able to input the tasks they intend to complete along with a rough estimate of the duration it will take to complete the tasks. These tasks will be shown as complete on the list when completed. If the user wishes, the program may send out notifications when certain intervals in the expected completion time have been met, implying how far along in the process the user should be at the time.
