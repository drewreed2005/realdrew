## Overview

In this post, I show what I've learned over the course of this trimester by redirecting to some old posts and clarifying what I learned in them with hindsight.

### Week 0

Week 0 was the setup week. I ended up having to be regraded because there was a problem with my Fastpages that nobody understood, but eventually, after making a new one, everything ended up working perfectly.

In [this post](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/25/bashstuff.html), I prove that I have installed all of the expected things. There isn't much else to say about this week aside from that it set up for the rest of them.

### Week 1

Week 1 was possibly the one I spent the most time coding during, just because I was so fascinated by all of the possibilities. I blogged my progress every single day as I explored modules (particularly random, I found it fascinating), quizzes, lists, indexes and different types of values (strings, integers, and even floats).

I was still shaky on understanding how to translate a code program to a website. Jupyter notebooks didn't let me interact with my code like I could in VSCode, which frustrated me. To see everything I got up to during that week, check out [this review ticket](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/27/week1reviewticket.html).

### Week 2
