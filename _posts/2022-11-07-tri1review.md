## Overview

In this post, I show what I've learned over the course of this trimester by redirecting to some old posts and clarifying what I learned in them with hindsight.

### Week 0

Week 0 was the setup week. I ended up having to be regraded because there was a problem with my Fastpages that nobody understood, but eventually, after making a new one, everything ended up working perfectly.

In [this post](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/25/bashstuff.html), I prove that I have installed all of the expected things. There isn't much else to say about this week aside from that it set up for the rest of them.

### Week 1

Week 1 was possibly the one I spent the most time coding during, just because I was so fascinated by all of the possibilities. I blogged my progress every single day as I explored modules (particularly random, I found it fascinating), quizzes, lists, indexes and different types of values (strings, integers, and even floats).

I was still shaky on understanding how to translate a code program to a website. Jupyter notebooks didn't let me interact with my code like I could in VSCode, which frustrated me. To see everything I got up to during that week, check out [this review ticket](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/27/week1reviewticket.html).

### Week 2

Week 2 was what really challenged be to code effectively and somewhat more professionally in this class. Data Abstraction is one of the concepts I'm strongest at (I think) right now, but back then, I was applying what I understood and throwing out there whatever else I manage to accomplish.

I think ["The Survey"](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/survey/) shows both my personal application of what I was learning and my lack of knowledge about iteration. My [Lists and Dictionaries Notes](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/landdnotes/) do involve some amount of iteration and recognizing the differences between strings, integers, lists, etc., but I still did not know how customizable loops could be.

The table I made in my [review ticket](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/09/04/week2reviewticket.html) was the first little bit of CSS and HTML I would try.

### Week 3

This week's main focus was the AppLab quiz, which was my first real experience with Javascript (or at least something very similar). I also covered the Create Task criteria in [my blog](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/applabquiz/) about the quiz.

### Week 4

Week 4's main focus was on the Python/Flask server, which primarily tested my patience as many problems with Python environments got in the way. The fruit of this work can be see in [my video](https://youtu.be/POALOn1CRIc).

This was also the first week of College Board lessons. My notes on Collaboration can be found [here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/2022/09/18/collaborationnotes.html).

### Week 5

This was my first actual introduction to Javascript, which I struggled to understand because the introductory content was kind of complex. [Here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/javascriptnotes/) are my attempts at understanding it.

This week was also the beginning of The Watchers and of my role as the Scrum Master.

### Week 6

Deployment was largely a process taken up by the Watchers' DevOps Trent Cardall, so I was only partially involved in that process.

In regards to College Board, this week, I took [notes on Program Design](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/programdesignnotes/) and reviewed [my results on the College Board quizzes](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/collegeboardmcq/).

In line with Program Design, I helped to make this [planning post](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/workwatchddplan/) for our group's project "The Work Watch". I made most of the UML diagram.

### Week 7

This week was all about APIs, with a little focus on Correcting Errors (which I took notes on [here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/identifyingerrorsnotes/) by applying what was covered in the lesson). APIs would go on to be used in our final project.

My first efforts at understanding APIs are found in [this post](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/rapidapinotes/).

### Week 8

We continued to cover APIs during this week, which I did not blog about (as I mostly focused on the API from the previous week).

I also took [notes on the Internet](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/theinternetnotes/) lesson on College Board, which was a pretty difficult and comprehensive set of information. I also discussed [my score](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/internetmcqreflection/) on the Internet College Board MC quiz.

### Week 9

This week was all about coding our final project and making our own API. Devon was gone, but as the Scrum Master, I took up making the backend part of our program. You can find our [Alarm API](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/data/alarms) here.

This was a giant coding week. I coded a large portion of the frontend for our program The Work Watch. The finished program can be found [here](https://jagermi3ster.github.io/theworkwatch/workwatch).

### Week 10

This week was dedicated to making finishing touches. We connected our Alarm API to the Work Watch, created [The Watchers Fastpages](https://jagermi3ster.github.io/theworkwatch/), and worked together on [The Work Watch Review Ticket](https://jagermi3ster.github.io/theworkwatch/watchersreviewticket).

### Week 11

This week! I finished my [Night at the Museum blog](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/natmblog) and created this review of all my progress. After taking the final, I went over the challenging questions [here](https://drewreed2005.github.io/realdrew/cbfinalreflection).
