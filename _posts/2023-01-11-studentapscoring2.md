## Submission 1

This is a memory game in which you are shown pictures of five animals (according to the code, always being "Cat," "Dog," "Duck," "Monkey," and "Fish") and you have to identify which ones you rememember seeing

### Grading

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The student doesn't state the program's purpose, instead just saying what it is. Not exactly its function, but just what it is. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Multiple lists are shown, but not the lists being called. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | How the lists manage complexity is poorly described. No alternative is provided. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The function `evaluateGuess` is shown being created and called. However, how it contributes to the functionality is not explained. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | Sequencing, selection, and iteration are all used in the procedure, but the description of how it works is very minimal. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The procedure is tested with two different plausible sets of variables with different results. |

## Submission 2

This is a program that creates short poems based on a set of words you provide it. It basically just concatenates them together, it looks like.

### Grading

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose is clearly stated to be to explore the user's creativity through poetry. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 1 | `nounList` is shown being defined. However, the procedure in which it is called is not shown, instead showing the base defined procedure for some reason. This is why I didn't give it the point. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The student clearly describes how using it in a list makes the program less complex, and provides an example of if it wasn't used. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The `createPoem` function is shown, with its importance to the function clearly explained. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Sequencing, selection, and iteration are all used in the procedure above, and how it works is made very clear. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Two calls are shown with clearly different results. |

## Submission 3

The program compares abstract stats assigned to various Marvel superheroes, then determines who won. It's not made clear to the user exactly how the winner is determined.

### Grading

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | He states what the program does (its function) rather than its purpose. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Data is shown being stored and called in the list `firstCharacterList`. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The student clearly describes how storing the URL data for each character decreases complexity, as it consolidates seven variables into one list. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The function `findWinner` is shown being defined and called. It is clear how its presence contributes to the functionality of the program. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Sequencing, selection, and iteration are all used in the procedure above. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Two calls are shown with clearly different results. |

## Submission 4

This is a Scratch MIT program which simulates an 8-letter version of Wordle, called "Octordle."

### Grading

| Reporting Category | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments |
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose is stated to be to challenge the user's critical thinking. Its function is well-described. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Though a list called `guesses` is used, since only its length is called and not the actual elements of the list, it doesn't meet the College Board criteria. |
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The list is only used for its length, it doesn't manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The procedure `isitcorrect` is shown being defined and called, and it has the parameter `checkanswer`. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Sequencing, selection, and iteration are all used in the procedure above. |
| Testing | 0 | 0 | Two different arguments are not shown, instead just describing the conditions. |
