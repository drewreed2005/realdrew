# Troubleshooting and Starting from Scratch

## The first days

Figuring it was homework to do so, I downloaded all of the programs listed in the Tools and Setup page and saved the fastpages part for the next day. This step would be a permanent help, even after the fastpages site had to be reset.

The problem that would lead to the loss of my admittedly little progress was evident from the very beginning: that Thurday, even after following all the steps listed in the first pull request, I had either forgotten to resolve the request or something had prevented me from doing so. Either way, by the next day, it seemed that there was no way to resolve the request, causing my website to look far less professional than other students' I had seen. It's surprising how much a lack of proper UI can make a site go from a 2022 professional business site to a 2008 fan site.

## Showing off

I tried to make some **bold** and *italicized* text in my About Me section, but the site bug made it impossible for the link redirects to work. Headers worked on the home page but subheaders did not. A notebook post making use of the Python "print" command was created as well, but the same issue with the About Me page existed.

## Anticipations

It looks like we'll expand upon our knowledge of Python this week. I'm exicted to use it to do funny things.

I'd really like to use a random number generator to make a page on my website which is different every time you load it. I'm not exactly sure how yet, but I'm sure it's possible. Why not boost my aspirations?
