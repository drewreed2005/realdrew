# Daily Posts

Every day this week, starting from when I had to restart the Fastpages site on Monday due to an issue with the setup pull request, I have made a blog post with Markdown to demonstrate both fluency with this type of file and to organize my work across each weekday.

These can all be found on the home page of the site, as well as by being searched for. They are named "[Day 1](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/22/post1.html)," "[Day 2](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/23/day2.html)," "[Day 3](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/24/day3.html)," and so on. Posts are not made on weekends (see "[Day 5](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/26/day5.html)" for why).

"[Day 4](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/25/day4.html)" contains an image at the top with a caption to fit a certain Hack.

# New Pages

As was suggested as one of the Hacks, I've made two new pages on the top bar: "[Notes](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/notes/)" and "[Quizzes and More](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/more/)."

## "[Notes](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/notes/)"

The "Notes" page contains links to various pages on the site which justify the site's academic utility. Various pages of notes will be found here.

### [Focus and Habits Notes](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/26/Focus-and-Habits-Notes.html)

As requested as a part of this week's schedule, I watched through the "Psychology and the Good Life" speech by Laurie Santos and took notes what it said about happiness, stress, and healthy habits.

To meet the Hack regarding posting a .docx file through the '_word' folder, the notes have been typed in Google Docs and exported as a Word file to put on the site.

### [Week 1 Python Notes](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/26/week1learning.html)

This notes page goes over some Python commands taught in the "Python Hello" page earlier this week. They are shown in action by mixing Markdown and Python cells in the Jupyter Notebook file. Within these Python cells are captions using `#` to explain what is being done. These aspects fit the expectations of multiple Hacks.

I also included some other commands I learned about on my own through independent research.

## "[Quizzes and More](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/more/)"

This is where I put some random non-post projects. Most of what is found in there contributes to specific Hacks, though some, like the Random Number Generator, were just made for fun.

### [Week 1 Python Quiz](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/22/randomnumber.html)

The "Python Hello" page we read through earlier in the week included a Hack asking the reader to make his or her own Python quiz, including a percentage score at the end.

Though the quiz does not actually run on the site, the outputs for all correct inputs can be seen beneath the Python code window.

To stop the quiz from being completely plagiar-inspired, I only reused necessary aspects of the original format and the defined `question_and_response` command. I added some additional things to prove fluency, such as a custom name input question (which lets the bot call you by a name of your choice throughout the quiz), a progress report three questions into the quiz (with a unique response depending on how many you got right), a percentage score at the end which determines whether or not you passed (you need at least 4/5 or 80% to pass), and an additional Easter egg if you named yourself Drew and got every question correct. This was a lot of fun to make.

### [Tool Check with Bash](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/25/bashstuff.html)

Later in the week, we were asked to use Bash to prove that we have all the necessary tools for the course. Instead of describing everything, I'll let the page speak for itself. You can click the hyperlink on the title of this section or the "Quizzes and More" page on the top bar to access.

### [Random Number Generator](https://mister-dew.github.io/realdrew/2022/08/22/randomnumber.html)

For fun, I made a random number generator using the `random.randrange` command. I thought it would be fun if the random number could cause different results based on what it was, so I gave an option for the RNG host (who I just named Python) to offer a second random number. If the numbers match (a 1/256 chance), Python will tell the user a secret. If the numbers are within 10 integer values of each other, the Python will remark that it was close, but not quite. Don't you dare cheat and read the secret in the code!
