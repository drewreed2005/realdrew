<p>Night at the Museum is a showcase of the progress and output of various CTE elective/fine arts classes. We were asked to go tonight and blog what we see. Below, I go class-by-class and discuss what I saw, what I enjoyed, and what impressed me most.</p>

<p>I came at 6PM to make sure I’d be able to see plenty of programs. I wasn’t able to take many pictures because of camera roll restrictions, but I managed to clear a lot of it by the time 7PM rolled around.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A group that made not just a working abacus, but a competitive math competition program that use can use the abacus with. The frontend and theming was very stylish.</li>
  <li>A K-pop-themed website with lots of cool features and a stylish composition. The search feature was a nice touch.</li>
  <li>A stats and calculus utility website that has a lot of practical use. It’s not just a calculator: it has mean/median/range calculators, a working Desmos API, a response bias test, and a scientific and derivative calculator. I kind of wish I had the link to this site to use it myself.</li>
  <li>Science Olympiad hub with cool signup feature. They didn’t seem very confident in it, but I think it had a lot of potential given enough time to polish it.</li>
  <li>Luke Angelini’s group in Mr. Yeoung’s class created the “Practice Nexus” for SAT practice. This was another practically useful program that I’d love to use again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Around the time I presented, I had a chance to look very briefly at the projects of some other people in my class. Here are some pictures of them my group collected with captions.</p>

  <figcaption>This one reminded me of the calc/stats calculator I saw early on, about as functional with better UI (in my opinion)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was hard to get to everyone because it was very crowded, but overall, the output was pretty impressive. We kept saying things like “What if we had done <em>__</em> instead?” or “I kind of which we had done something like that…”</p>

<p>It was great to receive feedback from people at the event. We presented our program to about 10 people total, including some friends we anticipated coming to the event.</p>

<p>Most of the feedback we received was about limiting the tasklist. We discussed it and realized that we really only restricted it at first because of a previous idea of concatenating new input windows onto the task menu before starting, which would have looked kind of cool. After this failed, we introduced the task box, but we didn’t have to limit the amount of tasks you could submit like we did with the previous idea. In hindsight, we either shouldn’t have limited it or should have allowed the user to input more than five tasks.</p>

<p>Trent showed us some cool stuff he saw in the ceramics class.</p>

<p>And here is a semi-tasteful FNAF reference I found in the 3D Animation room.</p>
