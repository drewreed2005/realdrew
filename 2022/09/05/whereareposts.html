<p>This week’s (and likely future weeks’) projects and work would not be as interesting or practical to give daily posts for because, for this week specifically, the vast majority of my time was spend on the survey. The rest of the objectives were finished quite quickly over the course of a few days. It likely would not have been practical to say <em>everything</em> I did each day; it is simply too time-consuming and wasteful of time I should be spending Code-Code-Coding.</p>

<h1 id="what-to-expect-in-the-future">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-to-expect-in-the-future" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What to Expect in the Future</h1>

<p>After much thought, I have decided on a way to perfectly use this class for self-expression: a text-based RPG! I can already forsee certain parts being greatly challenging and time-consuming to get through, but I have some pretty novel ideas that I wish to try.</p>

<p>In certain places, things I’ve always wanted to put in a game (such as adaptive music) will have to be sacrificed, and certain things I dislike like old-fashioned game UI and password-based save systems will have to be used due to platform restrictions. Do not expect a poor product, though!</p>

<p>All music featured in this game (and, yes, there <em>will</em> be music throughout the game!) will all be composed and produced by me. Any other contributors will be noted in the credits at the end.</p>

<p>Expect a turn-based battle system, a solid number of towns to travel to and interact with, an interesting and personalizeable magic system, upgradable equipment and weapons, an element system, and much, much more. I’m really excited to discuss progress at the end of each week!</p>

<p>What will the game be called? What is the scenario? These details are still being decided…</p>

<p>Feel free to leave ideas in the comments!</p>
