<p>As a requirement for this week (“Deployment”), we have been asked to show evidence that we have completed the multiple-choice College Board quizzes assigned to us.</p>

<p>As you can see, I got an unfortunate total of two questions wrong on these quizzes. I go into why I got them wrong below. In short, one is a matter I’m still confused about and the other was an oversight that I am completely at fault for.</p>

<h2 id="confusion">
<a class="anchor" href="#confusion" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Confusion</h2>

<p>For the most part, the quizzes have been fairly straight-forward. The only sort of confusion I’ve met have been regarding the answer choices and the given program examples.</p>

<p><img src="/realdrew/images/cbmcqwrong2.png" alt="Program Purpose question" width="600"></p>

<p>For example, in this case, answers “C” and “D” cannot be correct because they do not recognize that a copy of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numList</code> is being returned while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numList</code> itself isn’t being edited. Both “A” and “B” appear to be wrong too, however: “A” is correct that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> must be a number greater than or equal to zero, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be a value less than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> for the list swap to occur correctly (though it cannot be <em>equal</em> to k); and “B” is correct that both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> must be less than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LENGTH(numList)</code> because its length is one greater than the greatest index of the list, but the values do not have to be greater than or equal to <em>one</em> (instead, it should be <em>zero</em> because of zero-based index numbering).</p>

<p>I ended up deciding on “A” because the question was talking about code documentation rather than how exactly the code works. Maybe the programmer wants to express that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> should be less than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> simply because of how the rest of the program is intended to work. This makes the comment not necessarily an incorrect statement. However, the statement made about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> in “B” is just imprecise, as their values can be equal to zero and, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> were equal to each other, no swap would occur, so this range of possible index values is faulty. However, it is important to recognize that this comment specified that the two values must be less than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LENGTH(numList)</code>, a detail that isn’t included in “A”.</p>

<p>The answer ended up being “B” for the exact reason I explained it could have been. I likely should have recognized that “B” was arguably <em>more</em> correct with its recognition of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LENGTH(numList)</code>. I’m curious whether or not the coding language used in this question is zero-based, as I’m not exactly sure what it’s supposed to be. Regardless, the documentation in both cases is incomplete for different reasons. It is important for the documentation in “B” to recognize as well that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k</code> should not be equal to each other, or else no swap will occur.</p>

<p><img src="/realdrew/images/cbmcqwrong1.png" alt="Program Purpose question" width="600"></p>

<p>This question is an honest mistake on my part. I seem to have disregarded that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DISPLAY y</code> would only be recognized if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code> was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code>. I’ll be more careful when selecting answers next time.</p>
